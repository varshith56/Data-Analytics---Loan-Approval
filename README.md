# Data-Analytics---Loan-Approval
This project optimizes loan approval processes for financial institutions using data analytics and machine learning. By predicting loan approval outcomes based on historical data, it helps banks make data-driven decisions, reduce risks, and improve efficiency. Key techniques include logistic regression, decision trees, and data visualization.
## project objective
This project aims to optimize loan decision-making processes using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop and compare different predictive models to automate and improve the accuracy of loan approval decisions based on historical data from L&T Financial services. The project focuses on leveraging machine learning algorithms to extract patterns and insights from financial data, making the loan approval process more efficient, objective, and less susceptible to human biases.
